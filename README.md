# Human Perceptual Representations of Skin Lesion Features
Examining novice observer's perceptual representation of skin lesion features: shape asymmetry,
border irregularity, and colour variance. Across two projects, we examine single-feature perception
and how novice observers combine information across these features.

## Single Feature Perception
"pwc" (pairwise choice) directory contains the experimental scripts and data, figures, manuscript, and analysis scripts for a pairwise comparison task for the examination of single-feature  perception. 
We apply the Bradley-Terry-Luce model to generate quantitative ratio-scale measures of feature "strength" for a set of 10,000 skin lesion images pulled from the ISIC archive. 
We compare these feature strength scores to feature estimates generated by a computer vision (CV) algorithm.
Scripts and estimate outputs from the CV pipeline are also included herein. 

## Multi Feature Perception
"grt" (General Recognition Theory) directory contains the experiment and analysis scripts for a GRT task conducted across three conditions that analyse novice observers judgements of two features simultaneously (i: symmetry, border; ii: symmetry, colour; iii: border and colour). 

## Images
The images used in this project were pulled from the ISIC archive.
The resized images are included herein, along with the lesion masks derived by the computer-vision algorithm used in the "pwc" directory.
