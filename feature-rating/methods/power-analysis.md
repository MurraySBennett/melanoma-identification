The final sample-size was determined by selecting the number of trials required to achieve a minimum average 95% probability of a fully connected graph -- the probability that all stimuli are connected by at least one comparison. This metric correlated directly with the Bradley-Terry-Luce model deriving the true rank-order of the stimulus set. We simulated the perceptual choice task over 100 iterations for each combination of stimulus-pool sizes (5,000 - 70,000 in 5,000 step intervals) and total trials per condition (4,500-112,500 in steps of 450 trials). Our simulation power-analysis determined, for a 10, 000 stimulus pool, that 40, 500 trials return a 98% probability of a fully connected graph. Given 400 trials per participant, this equates to 102 participants per feature condition, or 306 participants for a survey of the asymmetry, border irregularity, and color variance conditions.
